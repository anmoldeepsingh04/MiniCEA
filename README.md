I have developed a python program to calculate the Adiabatic flame temperatures and their heat of reaction at a given Fuel to Air ratio, for a range of fuels. Openpyxl module present in python is used to manipulate the data present in CSV format and the Matplotlib module is used to plot the relevant graphs.
