I have developed a python program to calculate the Adiabatic flame temperatures and their heat of reaction at a given Fuel to Air ratio, for a range of fuels. Openpyxl module present in python is used to manipulate the data present in CSV format. 
Download both the .xlsx and .py file and keep them in the same directory to run it .py file.
